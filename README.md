## Cargo AoC
This project uses [`cargo-aoc`](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) to simplify the interactions with the server.

```
cargo install cargo-aoc
```

### Run
```
cargo aoc
```

## Resolution

### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)
Replace all textual occurences by the digits, but be careful to keep first and last letter to ensure overlapping digits are found.

### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)
Don't try to be smart and simply split and brute-parse the input. Use custom types `Draw` and `Game` to clean up the inner loops.

### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)
TODO

### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)
Don't try to be smart and simply split and brute-parse the input. Use custom types `Numbers` and `Card` to simplify inner loops, as always.
